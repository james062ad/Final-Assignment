# Render Deployment Process Documentation

## Overview
This document details the deployment process of the Road Safety Risk Assessment Tool to Render, including challenges faced and solutions implemented. The deployment was completed on March 5, 2024.

## Deployment Architecture
- Frontend: Vercel (`final-assignment-orpin.vercel.app`)
- Backend: Render (Python Flask API)
- Repository: GitHub (`https://github.com/james062ad/Final-Assignment.git`)

## Initial Setup Interruption
During the initial Render deployment setup, we encountered a Cursor AI crash. This led to:
1. Loss of ongoing configuration context
2. Need to restart the deployment process
3. Discovery of multiple deployment attempts

## Deployment Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Multiple Service Discovery
Found two services on Render dashboard:
- `Final-Assignment` (initially failed)
- `accident-risk-prediction` (successfully deployed)

Both services pointed to the same GitHub repository, ensuring identical functionality.

### 2. Technical Issues Encountered

#### a. Gunicorn Command Not Found
```bash
Error: bash: line 1: gunicorn: command not found
```
**Solution**: Modified build command to explicitly install gunicorn:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install gunicorn && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### b. Flask Import Error
```python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'
```
**Solution**: Updated build command to ensure proper installation order:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip && python -m pip install flask gunicorn flask-cors && python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Final Configuration
- Service Type: Web Service
- Environment: Python 3.9.0
- Region: Oregon (US West)
- Instance Type: Starter ($7/month) for 24/7 availability
- Auto-Deploy: Enabled from main branch

## Current Status
- Both frontend and backend are successfully deployed
- Application is accessible via `final-assignment-orpin.vercel.app`
- Backend API is running 24/7 on Render
- All machine learning models and features are operational

## Key Components Deployed
1. Flask Backend (`app.py`)
2. Machine Learning Model (`best_model.joblib`)
3. Risk Prediction System (`predict_risk.py`)
4. Data Visualizations
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Feature Importance
   - Risk Patterns
5. Policy Insights

## Maintenance Notes
- The $7 tier ensures continuous availability
- No cold starts
- Automatic deployments on code updates
- Environment variables properly configured
- Health checks implemented

## Lessons Learned
1. Importance of explicit dependency installation
2. Benefits of having multiple deployment attempts for comparison
3. Value of proper environment configuration
4. Need for clear build and start commands

## Future Considerations
- Monitor application performance
- Watch for any memory usage issues
- Consider setting up automated backups
- Plan for potential scaling needs
